  title: Differential expression {VER}
  subtitle: Find out genes that are expressed differently between groups
  description: >
    Accepts normalized assay and a selected method. Returns table having a row
    for each feature with statistics indiciating whether or not it is
    differentially expressed. The differential expression methods are described
    in Zhu, et al. 2017.
